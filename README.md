A web-based twitter-like micro posts application.
The application's API is supported via local CRUD application, JSON-SERVER. In order to provide the database, the user has to run the local server.
After the localserver is enabled, then the data can be sent and received. 
The user can add post title and post body and view them at the bottom of the page. If needed, the user can delete the posts or edit them. The page responds accordingly with corresponding alert and messages.

The live page can be found at http://doganmicroposts.surge.sh/ which is not optimally working due to missing local server running. In order to run the application, the local server must be up and running.
